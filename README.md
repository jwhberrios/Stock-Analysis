Green energy company stock analysis using VBA

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to refactor a VBA code that was used to analyze Green Energy Stocks in years 2017 and 2018 to determine which ones were best to invest in. After refactoring the code, performance of stock analysis was assessed based on completion time.

## Results
Refactoring the original VBA script led to large improvements in stock anaylsis for years 2017 & 2018.

## Summary
### Advantages
Somes advantages to refactoring code include cleaning up the code such as removing any redundancies. This is better for reuse and to be updated by others over time. Consequently, the liklihood of encountering errors will be reduced. Refactoring also makes the code easier to read and maintain. Lastly, as demonstrated in this assignment, the analysis running on a refactored code script gets more efficient with time.
### Disadvantages
While there are plenty of advantages to refactoring code, there are some disadvantages. Refactoring code requires extensive experience and time to avoid introducing other issues. While the make up of the code maybe improved, its functional analysis remains the same and no new functions can be added into the code as part of the refactoring prcess. 
### Advantages & Disadvanges to refactoring original VBA script
One clear advantage of refactoring the original VBA script was the improved performance in analyzing the stocks. Another advantage was looking up codes on this platform posted by previous students and I already saw how my refactored code is different where I used a nested for loop into my script while the ones I encountered just used a for loop, which appeared to look visually cleaner, and therefore easier to read and understand.  The disadvantage of refactoring is the extensive time it requires along with experience, which I am limited in both due to the nature of the boot camp.
